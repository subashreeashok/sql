on p.plantid=p1.plantfk where seeds<20 and date1= '14-APR-2012';

5.List the amount of sunlight and water to all plants with names that start with letter  'c' or letter 'r'.

6.  Write a valid SQL statement that displays the plant name and  the total amount of seed required for each plant that were plant in the garden. The output should be in descending order of plant name. 


    select p.name, pt.seeds from plant p inner join planted p1 on p.plantid=p1.plantfk order by p.name desc;


7. Write a valid SQL statement that calculates the average number of items produced per seed planted for each plant type:( (Average number of items = total amount picked / total seeds planted.) 



select p.name,(pc.amount/p1.seeds)as "AvgItems" 
from plant p inner join planted p1 on p.plantid=p1.plantfk 
inner join picked pc on p1.plantfk=pc.plantfk; 

8. Write a valid SQL statement that would produce a result set like the following: 

        name |  name  |    date    | amount 
       ------+--------+------------+--------

        Tim  | Carrot | 2012-08-18 |     28 

select g.name,p.name as 'veg_name',pc.date1,pc.amount from gardener g inner join picked pc on g.gardenerid=pc.gardenerfk inner join plant p on p.plantid=pc.plantfk 
where (g.name='Tim' and (p.name='Carrot' or p.name='Radish')) order by pc.amount;



9. Find out persons who picked from the same location as he/she planted. 


select distinct(name) from gardener g inner join planted pt on g.gardenerid=pt.gardenerfk inner join picked pc on g.gardenerid=pc.gardenerfk 
where pc.locationfk=pt.locationfk; 


10. Create a view that lists all the plant names picked from all locations except ’West’ in the month of August. 


select name from plant where plantid in
(select plantfk from picked where extract(month from date1)=8
 and locationfk!=2 group by plantfk);
